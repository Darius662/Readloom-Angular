# Metadata Providers

This document describes the behavior and implementation details of Readloom's metadata providers.

## Overview

Readloom supports multiple metadata providers for fetching manga and book information, including:

### Manga/Comics Providers:
- AniList (primary recommended provider for manga, enabled by default)
- MyAnimeList (via Jikan API, disabled by default)
- MangaDex (disabled by default)
- MangaFire (disabled by default)
- Manga-API (disabled by default)

### Book Providers:
- Google Books (primary recommended provider for books, enabled by default)
- Open Library (disabled by default)
- ISBNdb (disabled by default, requires API key)
- WorldCat (disabled by default, requires API key)

Only AniList and Google Books are enabled by default to improve initial performance and reduce unnecessary API calls. Other providers can be enabled in the Settings > Integrations > Metadata Providers section.

## Provider Behavior

## Release Date Handling

The calendar system has been enhanced to handle release dates from all providers:

1. **Date Format**: All dates are stored in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. **Missing Dates**: Empty dates are allowed and skipped during calendar updates
3. **Historical Dates**: All historical release dates are preserved and marked as confirmed
4. **Future Dates**: Only shows upcoming releases in the next 7 days by default
5. **Confirmation Status**: Tracks whether dates are confirmed or just predicted
6. **Publication Patterns**: Uses intelligent detection of publication schedules:
   - Weekly Shonen Jump titles release on Mondays
   - Monthly seinen magazines release on Thursdays
   - Korean manhwa release on Wednesdays

## Error Handling

1. **Null Chapter Numbers**: Automatically converted to "0" to satisfy database constraints
2. **Invalid Dates**: Skipped during import and calendar updates
3. **Missing Data**: Default values provided for required fields
4. **API Errors**: Cached data used when available, errors logged for debugging

## Cache System

1. **Cache Types**:
   - `manga_details`: Basic manga information
   - `chapters`: Chapter lists and release dates
   - `chapter_images`: Chapter page images

2. **Cache Duration**: Default 7 days, configurable via settings

3. **Cache Invalidation**:
   - Automatic refresh on import
   - Manual refresh via API endpoint
   - Expired items removed during cleanup

## Best Practices

1. **Provider Selection**:
   - For manga/comics:
     - Use AniList as the primary provider (most comprehensive data, enabled by default)
     - Only enable additional providers as needed:
       - MangaDex for additional chapter information
       - MangaFire for accurate volume information
       - MyAnimeList for supplementary metadata
   - For books:
     - Use Google Books as the primary provider (most accurate data, enabled by default)
     - Consider enabling additional providers for specific use cases:
       - Open Library for older or public domain books and author information
       - ISBNdb for detailed publication data (requires API key)
       - WorldCat for academic or library holdings information (requires API key)
   - For author searches:
     - Open Library is the recommended provider for author information
     - Use the dedicated author search type for best results
     - Author search provides biographies, photos, and bibliographies
   - Keep unused providers disabled to improve performance

2. **Release Date Management**:
   - Always include release dates when available
   - Use ISO format for consistency
   - Preserve historical dates with confirmation status
   - Follow realistic publication schedules for future dates

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - Validate chapter numbers before import
   - Check date formats
   - Handle null values gracefully
   - Use caching to prevent API overload

## Package Structure

Each metadata provider has been refactored into its own package with the following structure:

```
metadata_providers/
├── base.py              # Base provider classes
├── setup.py             # Provider registration and configuration
├── anilist/             # AniList provider (manga)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── provider.py
├── mangadex/            # MangaDex provider (manga)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── provider.py
├── googlebooks/         # Google Books provider (books)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── provider.py
├── openlibrary/         # Open Library provider (books & authors)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── provider.py
│   └── author_search.py # Author search functionality
├── isbndb/              # ISBNdb provider (books)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── provider.py
└── worldcat/            # WorldCat provider (books)
    ├── __init__.py
    └── provider.py
```

Frontend API endpoints for metadata:

```
frontend/
├── api_metadata_fixed.py       # General metadata API endpoints
├── api_author_metadata.py      # Author-specific metadata endpoints
└── api_author_search.py        # Author search API endpoints
```

This modular structure improves maintainability and makes it easier to add new providers.
