## Initial Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Errors

If you encounter database errors:

1. Make sure the database directory is writable
2. Try backing up and recreating the database:
   ```bash
   mv data/readloom.db data/readloom.db.bak
   ```

#### Port Already in Use

If port 7227 is already in use:

1. Change the port using the `-p` command line argument
2. Or modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use a different port

#### Integration Issues

If integrations with Home Assistant or Homarr aren't working:

1. Check network connectivity between the systems
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check the logs for error messages
4. For Home Assistant:
   - Ensure the correct API endpoint is configured in your configuration.yaml
   - Verify sensor entities are created correctly
5. For Homarr:
   - Ensure the status endpoint is correctly configured
   - Check that the Readloom service is properly added to your Homarr dashboard

#### Folder Structure Issues

If you encounter issues with folder creation or e-book management:

1. Verify the root folder exists and is writable
2. Check that series are properly added to the database
3. Run the helper scripts to create missing folders:
   ```bash
   python create_missing_folders.py
   ```
4. Check the logs for any errors during folder creation
5. Verify that the folder names match the series titles (with invalid characters replaced)
6. If folder names contain unexpected characters, check the sanitization rules in `helpers.py`

#### Collection Tracking Issues

If you encounter issues with collection tracking:

1. Verify the database is properly initialized
2. Check that series, volumes, and chapters are correctly added
3. Try importing a small collection first to test functionality

#### Notification Issues

If notifications aren't working correctly:

1. Check that you've subscribed to the appropriate series
2. Verify notification settings are configured correctly
3. For external notifications (email, Discord, Telegram):
   - Check that credentials and tokens are correctly entered
   - Verify network connectivity to external services
