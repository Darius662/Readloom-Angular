## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Readloom is using Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Readloom.git
cd Readloom

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

Readloom will be available at http://localhost:7227

#### Docker Compose Configuration

The default `docker-compose.yml` file includes the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  readloom:
    build: .
    container_name: readloom
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7227:7227"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/config
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    command:
      - "-o"
      - "0.0.0.0"
      - "-p"
      - "7227"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

#### Docker Volumes

The Docker container uses the following volume:

- `./data:/config`: Stores all Readloom data, including the database, logs, and e-books

#### Docker Environment Variables

- `TZ`: Set your timezone (default: UTC)
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: Ensures Python output is unbuffered for better logging

#### Docker Healthcheck

The Docker container includes a healthcheck that verifies the application is running properly. The healthcheck uses curl to check if the application is responding on port 7227.

#### Container Behavior

The Docker container is designed to keep running even if the Readloom application exits. This allows you to inspect logs and troubleshoot any issues that might cause the application to exit unexpectedly.

If you need to restart the application without restarting the container, you can use:

```bash
docker exec -it readloom python Readloom.py -d /config/data -l /config/logs -o 0.0.0.0 -p 7227
```

To view logs:

```bash
docker logs readloom
```

To access the container shell:

```bash
docker exec -it readloom /bin/bash
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you can't access Readloom at http://localhost:7227 or http://127.0.0.1:7227, try the following:

1. **Check if the container is running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep readloom
   ```

2. **Check container logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs readloom
   ```

3. **Run the debug script**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it readloom /usr/local/bin/docker-debug.sh
   ```

4. **Check if the port is correctly mapped**:
   ```bash
   docker port readloom
   ```

5. **Try accessing with your Docker host IP**:
   If you're using Docker Desktop, try using the Docker host IP instead of localhost.
   
6. **Restart the application inside the container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it readloom python Readloom.py -d /config/data -l /config/logs -o 0.0.0.0 -p 7227
   ```

7. **Check firewall settings**:
   Make sure your firewall allows connections to port 7227.

### Manual Installation

   ```bash

  - When enabled, only confirmed releases appear in the calendar (Sonarr/Radarr-like behavior).
  - When disabled, all predicted releases appear in the calendar.

### E-book Settings

- `ebook_storage`: Path to the e-book storage directory (default: "ebooks")
  - This can be a relative path within the data directory or an absolute path
  - E-books are organized by content type and series name within this directory
- `task_interval_minutes`: How often to scan for new e-book files (default: 60)
  - The system will automatically scan for new files at this interval
  - You can also manually trigger a scan from the series detail page

### Command Line Arguments

- `-d, --DatabaseFolder`: The folder to store the database in
- `-l, --LogFolder`: The folder to store logs in
- `-f, --LogFile`: The log file name
- `-o, --Host`: The host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
