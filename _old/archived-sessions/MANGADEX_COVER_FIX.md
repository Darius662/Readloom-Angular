# MangaDex Cover Images Fix

## Issues

### Issue 1: Incorrect Cover URL Construction
MangaDex manga covers were not displaying properly in the Readloom application. Instead of the actual manga covers, the application was showing a MangaDex logo placeholder.

### Issue 2: Empty Fallback Image
The fallback image (`no-cover.png`) was an empty file (0 bytes), so when the actual cover image failed to load, nothing was displayed.

### Issue 3: CORS Issues with External Images
Even with the correct URLs, browsers may block loading external images due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions.

## Root Causes

### Root Cause 1: Incorrect URL Format
The issue was in the cover URL construction in the MangaDex provider implementation. The provider was attempting to add a `.512.jpg` suffix to the cover filenames, which is not compatible with the current MangaDex API response format.

The proper cover URL format from MangaDex is:
```
https://uploads.mangadex.org/covers/{manga_id}/{filename}
```

Where:
- `manga_id` is the unique identifier for the manga
- `filename` is the cover art filename provided in the API response

### Root Cause 2: Missing Fallback Image
The fallback image was an empty file, so it couldn't be displayed when needed.

### Root Cause 3: CORS Restrictions
Browsers enforce CORS restrictions for security reasons, which can prevent loading images from external domains.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Updated Cover URL Construction
1. Updated the `_get_cover_url` method in `mangadex.py` to properly handle the MangaDex cover art URLs:
   - Removed the `.512.jpg` suffix addition
   - Better error handling to return an empty string when covers can't be found
   - Simplified the URL construction logic

2. Updated the related methods (`search()` and `get_latest_releases()`) to use the improved `_get_cover_url` method consistently.

3. Cleared the cache to ensure the changes take effect immediately.

### Fix 2: Created Proper Fallback Image
Created a proper `no-cover.png` image that displays when the actual cover image fails to load.

### Fix 3: Implemented Image Proxy
1. Created an image proxy service (`image_proxy.py`) to fetch external images through the server.
2. Updated the frontend templates to route external image URLs through the proxy.
3. Added CORS headers to the proxy responses to ensure the browser can display the images.

## Implementation Details

### Image Proxy
The image proxy service handles fetching external images and serves them with proper CORS headers:
- Created a new Flask Blueprint in `frontend/image_proxy.py`
- Added a `/api/proxy/image` endpoint that accepts a URL parameter
- The endpoint fetches the image from the external source and returns it with appropriate headers
- Updated the search template to use the proxy for external images

### Fallback Image
Created a proper fallback image that displays when the actual cover image fails to load:
- Created a script to generate a simple "No Cover" placeholder image
- Ensured the image has proper dimensions and content

## Testing
The fixes were tested by:
1. Clearing the MangaDex provider cache
2. Searching for "dandadan" manga
3. Confirming that the API returns a valid cover URL
4. Verifying that the image proxy correctly fetches and serves the images
5. Verifying that the covers display properly in the UI
6. Testing the fallback image by using an invalid URL

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter similar issues with other providers, check their API documentation for the correct image URL format and update the corresponding provider implementation.
- The image proxy also helps with other potential issues such as referer checking by some image hosts.
- Consider implementing caching for proxied images to improve performance and reduce external API load.
