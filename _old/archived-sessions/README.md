# Archived Session Documentation

This folder contains documentation from previous development sessions, bug fixes, and temporary notes.

## Purpose

These documents are archived because they:
- Document temporary fixes or workarounds
- Contain session-specific implementation notes
- Are superseded by newer documentation
- Document issues that have been resolved

## When to Use These Files

- **Debugging old issues** - If you encounter a problem from a previous version
- **Understanding implementation history** - To see how features were developed
- **Finding workarounds** - For issues that may still affect some users

## Organization

Files are organized chronologically and by topic:

- **Session summaries** - Overview of work done in specific sessions
- **Bug fixes** - Specific fixes for reported issues
- **Implementation notes** - Technical details about specific features
- **Testing guides** - Guides used during development and testing

## Important Note

**Most of these files are outdated.** For current information:

1. Check the main documentation sections
2. Review the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md)
3. See the [Versions](../versions/) section for version-specific info
4. Check [Known Issues](../troubleshooting/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

## Cleanup

These files are kept for historical reference but are not actively maintained. If you find useful information here, please consider:

1. Adding it to the main documentation
2. Creating an issue if it documents an unresolved problem
3. Updating the relevant section with current information
